Hybrid particle--field simulations switch out the ordinary particle--particle
`Lennard-Jones`_ interactions with interactions between particles and a slowly
varying density field. In this way, the most expensive part of normal molecular
dynamics simulations is circumvented. In the Hamiltonian hPF-MD formalism
:cite:`bore2020hamiltonian`, the density field is
