HyMD uses Martini coarse-graining mapping. A Martini structure can be created in many ways. Here we use CHARMM-GUI to build it and then convert it into the `.h5` format that HyMD needs.
Let's use as an example a very small system of a DPPC bilayer with 8 DPPC in a box of size `[1.58750, 1.58750, 10.0]` nm.  
Start here: `CHARMM-GUI` > `Input Generator` > `Martini Maker` > `Bilayer Builder`  
We will build a `Martini only system`  
`Select Martini Models:` Select `martini22`  
Follow the instructions. Note that distance units is `Ã…`.  
Download and unzip the `.tgz` file to get folder `charmm-gui-XXXXXXXXXX`. This folder contains a `gromacs` folder with all necessary files you need to run Gromacs simulations (`.pdb`, `.mdp`, `.top`, etc.) It also contains a `toppar` folder with the necessary forcefield (Martini) files.

#### `.pdb` to `.gro` without Gromacs run
The main file we need is the `pdb` file. It is usually called `step5_charmm2gmx.pdb`.  
__Way 1:__ If you don't care about a gromacs pre-run before switching to HyMD format, this is the only file you need.  
One of the many ways to convert `.pdb` to `.gro` :  
`vmd step5_charmm2gmx.pdb`  
Right-click on the file in `vmd` and click `save coordinates`. Select `.gro` format and write `all`.
Name the file `step5_charmm2gmx.gro`

__Way 2:__ Use `gmx pdb2gmx -f step5_charmm2gmx.pdb -o step5_charmm2gmx.gro`. Make sure you use the correct forcefields. All relevant forcefields should be in the folder `toppar` though some Gromacs versions might cause some errors and require some additional files (like `.atp`)

#### Do a Gromacs run and get a `.gro`
__Way 3__: See `job_charmm_equil.sh`. In this script we run Gromacs for energy minimization, some NPT equilibration runs with different time steps, an NPT production run, an NVT equilibration, an NVT production run. Of the many output files, we get the final frame as a `.gro` file.
